# TriangleChess2
The previous TriangleChess lacked an AI to play against. This version technically has an AI you can play against, however you can't associate the word "intelligence" with this AI since it is both basically deterministic and very stupid. As of the time of the original publication I could use just one rook to capture 7 pawns.
